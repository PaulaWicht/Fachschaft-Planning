# Agenda

- position of Fachschaft towards Gayas workshop
- setting up Fachschaft events which don't involve drinking 
- christmas party 

# Meeting
**Present: Bo, Gaya, Paula, John (Discord), Nicolai**


1. Position of Fachschaft for Workshop of "Triangle of Life" by Gaya. 
As the Fachschaft shares the values to empower and support students, every idea should be given a try. 
Fachschaft will provide room, the Fachschaft advertisment channel may be used for the workshop. Will create feedback form to get resonance of poeple

Feedback by Gaya: he feels not very supported and feels very little trust by the Fachschaft, which surprised/disappoints him, as he thought the Fachschaft is there
to support people
Feedback from Bo: admit that there was a certain biased for the workshop, but is happy to try it out now
Feedback from Paula: unhappy that that the "position of the Fachschaft" was not firstly discussed and democraticly voted in the meeting before. Would have wished more transparency on how we finalized the "position of the Fachschaft"
Furthermore: as the workshop doesn't seem to harm any priciples of democracy, peace and is non-conspiracy, Paula sees no right in rejecting the workshop, just because it doesn't "feel" good  

Materials the Fachschaft provides: 
theoratically whiteboard and pinboard which is yet both not hung up. 
Gaya tells the date to Fachschaft and if he wants creates advertisement.


2. events that do not evolve drinking
suggestions: 
- hiking with Sofia and Nicolai
- game night with Rofaida
